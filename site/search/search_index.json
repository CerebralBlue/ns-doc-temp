Turn on multi-agent on the config tab and easily build category-driven multi-agent flows. No coding required! Every node of the multi-agent tree can have its own configuration (kb, llm's, everything) and guardrails. We've also unified the Seek and mAIstro sides of the house so you can call both from either api.<ul> <li>Each node can be of a traditional \"seek\" type, or a new mAIstro-lead node. mAIstro nodes send intents that hit them to a default action instead of creating a new intent. This lets you do disambiguation or focus the user onto capabilities you have enabled - like opening trouble tickets or other mAIstro-lead actions</li> <li>Any intent can directly run a mAIstro flow. So for a question like \"what's the weather like today\" you could call out to a mAIstro flow instead of sending that to the traditional seek path/kb.</li> <li>You can now directly add a new intent via the config and curate tabs.</li> <li>Guardrails can run mAIstro flows.  Min confidence, Min words and max words all can run custom mAIstro flows to give contextually &amp; language -specific responses when those guardrails are hit.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Chat!  We've introduced a ChatGPT-like interface, as well as an SDK and embed code. You can quickly add a virtual agent to your website just by dropping in the embed code. The Chat SDK allows for drag &amp; drop image and file operations - so you could easily build a bot that allows users to ask questions by providing images, such as \"I want a refrigerator like this one\"</li> <li>OCR!  We soft-launched our OCR capabilities a few weeks back but never announced it. We now have OCR embedded into the system. When you use or document loader or upload a file into mAIstro - we'll automatically OCR any pdf's we find that are image-based and not text. You can also OCR image files. In addition we released a \"dual ocr\" template - basically showing you how to leverage and parralelize our OCR in addition to visual capabilities of a multi-modal model to do some amazing things for OCR'ing complex documents while keeping source formatting. This capability just blows away legacy OCR tools, with almost no tuning.</li> <li>Document Generation - we have built a new document generation behind the scenes, enabling greater capability in generating well-formatted PDF and Word files at scale.</li> <li>LLM's!  LLama3.2 on both bedrock and watsonx.ai. This is the first multi-modal model available on watsonx. </li> <li>new curated model!

We released an XML toolkit, as well as about a dozen other new nodes &amp; connectors</li> <li>translation enhancements!

It also weighs heavily on caching and how the data can be cached.  For example - The answer to a user question like \"how does it work\" depends heavily on the previous statements from a user.  NeuralSeek requires that you pass an ID that can uniquely identify a user's session to enable this conversational context.
